xkcd-desktop.py
---------------

Fetches the latest XKCD comics and places it as your desktop background.
Uses XKCD's json interface http://xkcd.com/info.0.json
Sets the background white. You could configue it to your taste.

I'm using Humor-Sans font[1] for the text.

Recommended: Put a crontab as such,
0 15 * * mon,wed,fri python /path/to/xkcd.py

NOTE: Works only on GNOME now. 
TODO: Add support for other desktop environments.
